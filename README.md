# Pong

Pong, originally manufactured by Atari and released in 1972, is a table tennis-themed game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics.

This project is a replica of this classic game, built in python using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) module, built for the GLHS Game Development Club.
Player 1's bumper is controlled using the W and S keys; Player 2's bumper is controlled using the I and K keys.

WARNING: While the window is resizable, the score font misbehaves if the window is significantly taller than it is wide.
